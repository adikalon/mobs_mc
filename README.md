# Minecraft Mobs [`mobs_mc`]

This is a fork of a long unsupported [mod for mobs from minecraft for minetest](https://github.com/maikerumine/mobs_mc)

![Preview](./screenshot.png)

## Description

* Non-functional items have been removed
* Many mobs and their mechanics are simplified
* Removed mobs, improved analogues of which exist in other mods on minetest
* Spawn of many mobs depends on additional mods: nether, naturalbiomes, livingjungle, mg_villages, etc.
* All changes are subjective vision of the author and do not try to match the original minecraft mechanics
